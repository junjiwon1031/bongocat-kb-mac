## Original Work Attribution

Bongo Cat character was originally created by:
- **@StrayRogue** — Original cat character animation
- **@DitzyFlama** — Added bongos, creating the "Bongo Cat" meme (May 2018)

Sprite assets in this project are inspired by the
[Bongobs-Cat-Plugin](https://github.com/a1928370421/Bongobs-Cat-Plugin) by **a1928370421**,
an OBS Studio plugin for Bongo Cat overlays (licensed under GPL-2.0).

This project (BongoCatNoMouse) is an independent reimplementation for macOS
and does not share code with the original OBS plugin.
